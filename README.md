# 🚀 LRU Cache Interview Assignment

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Implement a **thread-safe**, **in-memory**, **Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache** in Java.

### Requirements:
- The cache must support **generic key-value** pairs
- Eviction policy should be **Least Recently Used (LRU)**
- It should be **thread-safe**
- Cache should have a **fixed capacity**
- Ensure the design is **testable** with unit tests

## ✅ Evaluation Criteria

- 🔁 Correctness of LRU eviction logic
- 🔐 Thread safety and concurrency handling
- 🧠 Choice of data structures
- 🧪 Unit testability and coverage
- 📏 Memory constraint handling
- 📦 Clean, modular, and idiomatic Java code
